# Budget-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-
This repository contains a work‑in‑progress Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize a sample personal budget. The goal of this project is to demonstrate data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design skills using realistic but non‑sensitive financial data

# Project Overview
The dashboard presents a comprehensive view of an individual's financial situation, including:
- **Bank account balances** in both PLN and EUR
- Investment portfolio value
- Total net worth calculated dynamically
- Month‑to‑month budget changes visualized through interactive charts
The report is still under development, and additional features, visuals, and data transformations will be added over time.
