# 📊 Budget-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-
This repository contains a work‑in‑progress Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize a sample personal budget. The goal of this project is to demonstrate data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design skills using realistic but non‑sensitive financial data

# 🧾 Project Overview
The dashboard presents a comprehensive view of an individual's financial situation, including:
- **Bank account balances** in both PLN and EUR
- **Investment portfolio value**
- **Total net worth** calculated dynamically
- **Month‑to‑month budget changes** visualized through interactive charts
The report is still under development, and additional features, visuals, and data transformations will be added over time.


# 📁 Data Sources
The dataset used in this project comes from:
- **Google Docs** – source of the personal budget data (bank balances, investments, monthly changes)
- **Google Finance currency data** – EUR → PLN exchange rate retrieved from
https://www.google.com/finance/markets/currencies
The exchange rate is refreshed automatically whenever the report is updated, ensuring that all EUR values are converted to PLN using the latest available rate.

# 🔧 Key Features
- **Dynamic currency conversion** (EUR → PLN) based on live Google Finance data
- **Net worth calculation** combining bank accounts, investments, and currency adjustments
- **Trend analysis** showing how the budget evolves month by month
- **Interactive visuals** allowing users to explore financial changes over time

# 🚧 Status: Dashboard in Progress
This is an **ongoing project**. Planned improvements include:
- Additional financial KPIs
- More advanced DAX calculations
- Enhanced visual design
